# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our SIEM system seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### 🚨 How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing: **security@siem-project.org** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 📋 What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its impact and severity
3. **Fix Development**: We will work on developing a fix for the vulnerability
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Update all default passwords in `.env` file
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all services
   - Enable authentication for Elasticsearch and Kibana in production

2. **Network Security**
   - Use TLS/SSL for all communications
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Configure firewalls to restrict access
   - Use VPN for remote access

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Use API keys for external integrations
   - Apply principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement proper log retention policies
   - Sanitize logs before sharing
   - Regular security audits

### For Development

1. **Code Security**
   - Never commit secrets or credentials
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
   - Use only trusted packages
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests in CI/CD
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Perform regular penetration testing
   - Code reviews for security issues

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Authentication**: Basic implementation - production deployments should implement proper authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control not fully implemented
3. **Encryption**: TLS/SSL not enabled by default - must be configured for production
4. **Input Validation**: Basic validation implemented - may need enhancement for specific use cases

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 / OIDC integration
- [ ] Enhanced input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Audit logging for all administrative actions
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## 🔍 Security Testing

We encourage security testing and welcome reports. However, please:

1. **Test Responsibly**
   - Only test against your own installations
   - Do not test against production systems without permission
   - Respect rate limits and system resources

2. **Scope of Testing**
   - Web application security (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks)
   - API security (authentication, authorization, input validation)
   - Infrastructure security (Docker, database configurations)
   - Data handling and privacy

3. **Out of Scope**
   - Social engineering attacks
   - Physical attacks
   - Denial of service attacks
   - Testing against third-party services

## 📜 Security Compliance

This SIEM system can be configured to support compliance with:

- **SOX** (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**

### Compliance Features

- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access and authentication
- **Encryption**: Support for data encryption in transit and at rest
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities

## 🛠️ Security Configuration

### Production Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Enable TLS/SSL for all services
- [ ] Configure proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Set up proper backup and recovery
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Network segmentation
- [ ] Intrusion detection system
- [ ] Regular security assessments
